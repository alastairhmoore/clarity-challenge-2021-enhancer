# clarity-challenge-2021-enhancer

An MVDR beamformer designed to comply with the rules of the [2021 Clarity Enhancement Challenge](https://claritychallenge.github.io/clarity_CEC1_doc/) 


## Installation

This repository includes submodules so for a one line setup do


    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/alastairhmoore/clarity-challenge-2021-enhancer.git


The beamformer uses the head related impulse responses (HRIRs) which are downloaded when the [https://github.com/claritychallenge/clarity_CEC1/](clarity challenge tools) are installed.  You will need to know the path where these are installed.


## Usage
In Matlab...

    cd 'path/to/clarity-challenge-2021-enhancer'
     
    % add paths of subdirectories
    setup

    % specify path of folder which is the parent of the 'HRIRs_MAT' directory
    % if you skip this step you'll be asked to pick it
    hrir_dir = 'path/to/hrirs'

    % run the enhancer using data distributed in this repository
    % feel free to modify!
    example



## Notes

The hearing loss compensation component of the enhancer depends on the gain table generated by the baseline system and stored in a openmha `.cfg` file. We include here an example generated for a user with no hearing loss so that the enhancer can be run with any external dependencies.

To make a `.cfg` file for a specific hearing loss we used the the clarity challenge tools with a small modifcation to `clarity_CEC1/projects/GHA/GHA/hearing_aid_interface.py` so that it doesn't delete its temporary files. Included in this repository is a patched version of that file.
